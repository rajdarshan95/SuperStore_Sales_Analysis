🚀 Thrilled to share my latest project: Super Store E-commerce Sales Analysis with Power BI! 📊

I recently completed a comprehensive e-commerce sales analysis project using Power BI, and I'm excited to highlight some of the key insights and visualizations. Here are some of the project’s main features:

🔍 Interactive Sales Dashboard: Created a dynamic dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of key sales metrics, including total revenue, quantity sold, and profit margins.

📆 Yearly Sales Trends: Tracked sales trends YoY to identify peak periods and areas needing attention.

📚 Product Category Insights: Analyzed performance across product categories, revealing top performers such as Technology with 36%.

🛒 Cart Value Insights: Segmented sales data to uncover cart value preferences, showing that the "Low" cart value segment gave the highest total sales, followed by "Medium" and "High."

💳 Shipment Method Analysis: A detailed examination of shipment methods showed that Standard class was the most dominant, followed by Second class and First class.
